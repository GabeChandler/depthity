# Code for method in "Multiscale geometric feature extractionfor high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data with applications", Annals of Statistics (2021) with Wolfgang Polonik

This repository contains R code for computing depth quantile functions are described in "Multiscale geometric feature extractionfor high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data with applications" by Chandler and Polonik.  In particular, the code is for computing these functions for Euclidean data.  For non-Euclidean data, one would need to compute the Gram matrix themselves and then call the remainder of the code that acts on that matrix.  

Also included here are larger versions of several of the figures used in the manuscript.
